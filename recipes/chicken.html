            inch deep. Heat to 350 degrees.</li>
        <li>Prepare the breading by combining the flour, cornstarch, onion powder, garlic

        <li>Place the breaded chicken into the 350 degree oil. Fry 3 or 4 pieces at a 
            time. The chicken will drop the temperature of the oil so keep it as close 
            to 350 degrees as possible. Fry each piece for 14 minutes, turning each 
            piece about half way through, until the chicken reaches an internal 
            temperature of 165 degrees F. </li>
        <li>Remove from the oil and place on paper towels. Let them rest for at least
             10 minutes before serving. </li>
