<h1>Ingredients</h1>

<ul>
    <li>1 1/2 cups uncooked long grain white rice</li>
    <li>1tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/2 tbsp chili powder</li>
    <li>1 zucchini</li>
    <li>1 red onion</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
    <li>8oz mushrooms</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp ground cumin</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
    <li>2tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>10 large flour tortillas</li>
    <li>2 15oz cans of black beans</li>
    <li>2 1/2 cups shredded cheese</li>
    <li>1 bunch fresh cilantro</li>
</ul>

<h1>Instructions</h1>

<ol>
    <li><strong>preheat your oven to 400 degrees.</strong> Chop the zucchini, bell pepper, onion, and mushrooms into 
        bite-sized pieces. Toss the vegetables with 2 Tbsp olive oil, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp cumin, 
        and 1/2 tsp oregano. Spread the vegetables out over a large sheet pan and roast for 40 minutes, 
        stirring once half way through.</li>
    <li><strong>Combine the rice</strong>in a medium pot with 1 tsp of salt and 1/2 Tbsp of chili powder.
         Add 3 cups of water, place a lid on top, and bring up to a boil over high heat. As soon as it reaches
          a full boil, turn the heat down to the lowest setting and allow it to simmer for 20 minutes. After 
          20 minutes, turn the heat off and let it sit undisturbed until you’re ready to assemble the burritos.
           Fluff the rice just before using.</li>
    <li><strong>When you’re ready to make the burritos,</strong> stack a few tortillas on a large plate, place a damp paper towel 
        over top, and microwave for 30 seconds. This will make the tortillas more pliable as you wrap the burritos.</li>
    <li><strong>Place 1/4-1/3 cup of rice on a tortilla,</strong> add 1/4 cup of black beans, 1/3 cup of the roasted vegetables, 1/4 cup of shredded 
        cheese, and a handful of fresh cilantro leaves. Roll the burrito tightly and wrap in plastic until ready to eat.</li>

</ol>

<h1><strong>Notes</strong></h1>
<p>The burritos can be heated in the microwave (remove plastic wrap), baked in the oven (smothered with enchilada sauce), crisped in a skillet, 
    or grilled in a countertop grill or sandwich press.</p>
